description: "Thinkful's Web Development Bootcamp combines an in-depth, project-based approach with three 1-on-1 sessions every week. This program is built to land beginners their first developer job without having to quit their existing one like all offline programs. In this fully online program you'll work side-by-side with a professional developer building interactive websites and apps. Your mentor will customize each phase of the course, so you can learn other JavaScript frameworks and build advanced capstone projects from scratch. You'll also gain valuable real-world experience working in a team setting as you collaborate with other students over GitHub and Slack.

  The Bootcamp can be taken at two paces: Full Time or Flexible.

  The Flexible Web Development Bootcamp is unique among bootcamps, in that it achieves the same end goals while remaining compatible with students' normal job schedules. In the Full Time Web Development Bootcamp, Thinkful students spend all day learning for 17 weeks straight. At this level of immersion, students require constant support, and are surrounded by a team of instructors, TA's, 1-on-1 mentors, as well as their classmates.

  In select cities, Thinkful leverages local networks to match students with mentors at top companies in their area. Currently, students in [Raleigh](https://www.thinkful.com/raleigh-tech-talent-pipeline/) and [Atlanta](https://www.thinkful.com/atlanta-tech-talent-pipeline/) can attend Thinkful-sponsored meetups and get an early beachhead into both cities' tech markets.

  Thinkful provides scholarships to all self-identifying women and military veterans of $100 per month for Flexible Web Development Bootcamp students. The school provides these in collaboration with Girl Code It, MotherCoders, and Operation Code. The women's scholarship can be redeemed [using this link](https://www.thinkful.com/join/sign-up?scholarship=women-scholarship-200) and the veteran's scholarship [can be redeemed here](https://www.thinkful.com/join/sign-up?scholarship=veterans-scholarship-200)."

      Thinkful’s Full Time Web Development Bootcamp shares the same in-depth,
      project-based approach of the Flexible pace. The main difference is that
      the Full Time pace pushes students to become web developers in 17 weeks
      and requires over 40 hours of effort per week. The fully online program
      features constant support, as students interact with their classmates,
      instructors, and mentors. Each student has a dedicated mentor, who they
      meet with daily 1-on-1 for half an hour.\n\nThe course teaches students
      full-stack JavaScript and features a “flex week,” in which students learn
      different technologies, including Ruby and Python. Students also use
      industry-standard collaboration tools such as GitHub and Slack.
